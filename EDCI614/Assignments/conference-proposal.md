### Assignment:

> Conference Proposalâ€”30%
The format for this assignment is roughly similar to the [Conference Abstract](http://grav.madland.ca/blog/conference-abstract-submitted) assignment, except that it offers you more space and hence the opportunity to provide a degree of greater detail regarding what you imagine you might present.
Length: 3 pages double-spaced (maximum), excluding works cited


### Mapping Openness in Education

The term *open education* and related terms have come to mean a wide variety of things depending on the context. To some, it reflects commitments to social justice and access in higher education (Funes & Mackness, 2018); to others, it is about using openly licensed materials to reduce student costs (Wiley, 2017); and still others see it as a set of pedagogies that utilize open education resources to improve learning outcomes (DeRosa & Jhangiani, 2018; Paskevicius, 2017). The lack of consistent definitions has the potential to lead to reduced clarity and precision in research in the field. This review attempts to map the primary definitions of open education in the literature in order to provide clarity and suggest a common foundation of terminology. Rather than seeking a single definitive description, I will argue there is a multi-dimensional spectrum of beliefs, artifacts, and practices which compose the field of open education. This diversity grows out of the roots of open education as a multi-disciplinary endeavour initiated and developed by faculty and administrators who share a common set of values about improving access to high-quality learning environments in higher education.

### A (Brief) History of Open Education

Audrey Watters (hackeducation.com, n.d.) often reminds her readers that we ignore the history of educational technology at our own peril. Her point is that the historical foundations of ideas and artifacts are important in interrogating modern trends. I argue that the same is true when thinking about *open education*. Lack of clarity or precision about what is meant by open education leads to difficulty for researchers and educators, and we might be well-served to explore the history of the concept.

Educators who have surveyed the literature on the history of open education (Hendricks, 2017; Morgan, 2016) have found that early conceptions of open education were primarily focused on creating student-centred learning environments in K-12 (Cuban, 2004) or more specifically "autonomy and interdependence; freedom and responsibility; democracy and participation" (Paquette, 2005, *trans.*). Morgan notes that there are distinct similarities between what Paquette advocated as far back as 1979 and that to which open educators currently aspire, such as: student choice and autonomy, connectedness, access, and student voice to name a few.



### Modern Conceptions
- Open Education practices (Cronin & MacLaren, 2018, Paskevicious, 2017)
- Social justice
- OER
- OER-enabled pedagogies
- open education as freedom
  - from surveillance
  - to contribute, share, exercise agency, access

### Points of Confusion
 - student-centred pedagogies
 - open licenses
 - inclusion that excludes

 Part of the difficulty is that there is a diverse, world-wide community working under the auspices of *open education* leading to localized solutions to localized problems and a balkanizing effect.
