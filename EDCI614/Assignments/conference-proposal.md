### Mapping Openness in Education

*Open education* (OE) has acquired a wide variety of meanings. To some, it reflects commitments to social justice and access in higher education (Funes & Mackness, 2018); to others, it concerns using openly licensed materials to reduce student costs (Wiley, 2017); and still others see it as a set of pedagogies that utilize open education resources to improve learning outcomes (DeRosa & Jhangiani, 2018; Paskevicius, 2017). While these are all important topics, the lack of a consistent definition could potentially lead to reduced clarity and precision in research on this topic. For example, educators might conflate OE with "good pedagogy". In response to that problem, this review maps the primary definitions of OE in the literature in order to provide clarity and suggest a common foundation for terminology. Rather than seeking a single definitive description, I will argue there is a multi-dimensional spectrum of historical and contemporary beliefs, artifacts, and practices that comprise OE. This diversity, and the need to be aware of it, grows out of the roots of OE as a multi-disciplinary endeavour initiated and developed by faculty and administrators who share a common set of values about improving access to high-quality learning environments in higher education.

### A (Brief) History of Open Education

Audrey Watters (hackeducation.com, n.d.) often reminds her readers that we ignore the history of educational technology at our own peril. Her point is that the historical foundations of ideas and artifacts are important in interrogating modern trends. I argue that the same is true when thinking about *open education*. Lack of clarity or precision about what is meant by open education leads to difficulty for researchers and educators, and we might be well-served to explore the history of the concept.

Educators who have surveyed the literature on the history of open education (Hendricks, 2017; Morgan, 2016) have found that early conceptions of open education were primarily focused on creating student-centred learning environments in K-12 (Cuban, 2004) or more specifically "autonomy and interdependence; freedom and responsibility; democracy and participation" (Paquette, 2005, *trans.*). Morgan notes that there are distinct similarities between what Paquette advocated as far back as 1979 and that to which open educators currently aspire, such as: student choice and autonomy, connectedness, access, and student voice to name a few.

#### Cape Town Open Education Declaration

In 2007 a small group of open educators met in Cape Town, South Africa and published the *Cape Town Open Education Declaration* which provides a clear description of their vision of the potential of open education as enabled by openly licensed materials. They wrote:

>The expanding global collection of open educational resources has created fertile ground for this effort. These resources include openly licensed course materials, lesson plans, textbooks, games, software and other materials that support teaching and learning. They contribute to making education more accessible, especially where money for learning materials is scarce. They also nourish the kind of participatory culture of learning, creating, sharing and cooperation that rapidly changing knowledge societies need. @CapeTownOpen, Para. 3

Clearly, early official statements regarding open education were focussed not only on the fact of open licenses, but possibly moreso on the fact that open resources can reduce costs for students and build a culture of highly effective learning environments.

The writers of the declaration go on to state:

>However, open education is not limited to just open educational resources. It also draws upon open technologies that facilitate collaborative, flexible learning and the open sharing of teaching practices that empower educators to benefit from the best ideas of their colleagues. It may also grow to include new approaches to assessment, accreditation and collaborative learning. Understanding and embracing innovations like these is critical to the long term vision of this movement. @CapeTownOpen, Para. 4



### Modern Conceptions
- Open Education practices (Cronin & MacLaren, 2018, Paskevicius, 2017)
- Social justice
- OER
- OER-enabled pedagogies
- open education as freedom
  - from surveillance
  - to contribute, share, exercise agency, access

#### Open Education Resources (OER)

In 2012, the provincial government of British Columbia announced funding for the creation of openly licensed textbooks for the 40 highest enrolment courses in BC post-secondary institutions. The project was to be stewarded by BCcampus. Since then, the BCcampus Open Textbook Repository has grown to over 200 open textbooks and other resources as provincial funding has expanded.

The defining characteristic of OER is that they are released under an open license, usually a Creative Commons license which allows end users to engage in five activities with materials (retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute), collectively known as the "5R permissions" or "the 5Rs" @wileyDefiningOpenOpenND.

The Open Textbook project in BC was not the first open education initiative in BC, but it has arguably had the most influence. With this influx of government funding and support for the creation, adaptation, and adoption of open textbooks, it is understandable that the focus in Western Canada has been on open education being primarily about reducing student costs. Other high profile initiatives in North America include the OpenStax project at Rice University, Saylor Academy, Lumen Learning and several institutions who have partnered with the Open Education Resources universitas (OERu).

There is a small, but growing, body of literature on the topic of the effects of the adoption of open textbooks in higher education. Much of the literature is focussed on the effect of open textbooks on Costs, Outcomes, Uses, and Perceptions (COUP) related to the use of open textbooks.

#### OER-enabled Pedagogies

David Wiley has been a tireless champion for the use of OER and open textbooks in higher education for many years. He is the chief steward and host of the Open Education Conference held each year and writes extensively on the topic. In 2017, David noticed that there were many instances of people using the term "open education" to mean different things and it was becoming difficult to speak or write meaningfully about it without causing confusion. Wiley's response to this was to coin a term that he hadn't previously seen in the literature so that he could be clear about what he meant. He chose to use the term "OER-enabled pedagogy" to refer to what he called:

> the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER. (Wiley, 2018, @wileyDefiningOEREnabledPedagogy2018).

Wiley's definition serves to move the emphasis from cost-savings for students to the unique ways that OER can be used by educators to engage their students.

#### Open Education Practices (OEP) and Open Pedagogies


### Points of Confusion
 - student-centred pedagogies
 - open licenses
 - inclusion that excludes

 Part of the difficulty is that there is a diverse, world-wide community working under the auspices of *open education* leading to localized solutions to localized problems and a balkanizing effect.

### Moving Forward
- invitation to contribute to a learning community
- *personalization, connectedness, openness (in terms of OER, etc.), assessment (for learning), and access (multi-access) (Irvine, unpublished)*
