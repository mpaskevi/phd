### First People's Principles of learning.
- Learning ultimately supports the well-being of the self, the family, the community, the land, the spirits, and the ancestors.
- Learning is holistic, reflexive, reflective, experiential, and relational (focused on connectedness, on reciprocal relationships, and a sense of place).
- Learning involves recognizing the consequences of one’s actions.
- Learning involves generational roles and responsibilities.
- Learning recognizes the role of indigenous knowledge.
- Learning is embedded in memory, history, and story.
- Learning involves patience and time.
- Learning requires exploration of one’s identity.
- Learning involves recognizing that some knowledge is sacred and only shared with permission and/or in certain situations.

### 5Rs
respect, relevance, reciprocity, responsibility, and relationships

# Seeing Open Education with Two Eyes

Open education (OE) has a relatively short history compared to other educational ideas, but it is a history rich with aspirations about democratizing education, increasing student voice, reducing barriers to formal learning opportunities, and promoting justice for marginalized groups and individuals. A citation analysis published by Weller, Jordan, DeVries, and Rolfe, (2018), showed the earliest roots of OE literature to be in both the 'open classroom' movement in the 1970s and in the distance education literature beginning in the 1980s. The open classroom movement originated in the UK following the Plowden report [\(Plowden, 1967\)](@plowdenChildrenTheirPrimary1967), which argued for a student-centred model of education with *open* referring to the physical space of a classroom and the design of learning activities. Distance education, while originating with analog technologies such as the postal service and radio, television, or satellite broadcasts pivoted to digital technologies with the advent of networked computer technologies. Both origins of OE reflect the aspirations of their advocates to broaden access to formal education.

A challenge to modern open educators is reconciling the continuing emphasis on enacting social justice narratives with the attempt to do so in a digital landscape that is decidedly hostile, by design, to enacting social justice narratives. In the Canadian context, the most pressing need for justice is embodied in the lives and communities of the Indigenous Peoples who have stewarded this land since time immemorial. OE, often, but not always digital, seems at first to be at odds with the traditional principles of learning practiced by Indigenous Peoples. According to Tessaro et al. [\(2018\)](@tessaroFiveIndigenizingOnline2018) Indigenous Education is heavily dependent upon being situated in a specific community context at a specific time, conversely, online education is designed to transcend place and time and be accessible to anyone regardless of their location. Indigenous Education is carried out in a context where teachers are very attuned to their students personalities, histories, needs, and goals, but online educators may never meet or even speak to any given student, so there is little chance that they will be able to understand the contexts of their students.

The following table outlines some of the major points of conflict between Indigenous education and online education as described by Tessaro, et al. [\(2018\)](@tessaroFiveIndigenizingOnline2018) (Table 1). Note that they refer to *online* education,not *open* education, but the characteristics of online education they describe are also characteristic of modern open education, which relies heavily on online technologies.  

| Indigenous education | Online Education |
| :--- | ---:|
| situated in a specific community | accessible across multiple communities  |
| highly contextual   | very low context  |
|experiential   | technologically mediated   |
|personal   | impersonal   |
|orally transmitted   | text-based  |

With such apparent contradictions in approaches to learning environments, it seems that open educators, despite their commitment to social justice, may have a very difficult time respectfully engaging with Indigenous Peoples in digital environments. A closer look, however, may tell a different story.
