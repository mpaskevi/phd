# Seeing Open Education with Two Eyes

Open education (OE) has a relatively short history compared to other educational ideas, but it is a history rich with aspirations about democratizing education, increasing student voice, reducing barriers to formal learning opportunities, and promoting justice for marginalized groups and individuals [\(2002\)](@ForumImpactOpen2002). A citation analysis published by Weller, Jordan, DeVries, and Rolfe, (2018), showed some of the earliest roots of OE literature to be in both the 'open classroom' movement in the 1970s and in the distance education literature beginning in the 1980s. The open classroom movement originated in the UK following the Plowden report [\(Plowden, 1967\)](@plowdenChildrenTheirPrimary1967), which argued for a student-centred model of education with *open* referring to the physical space of a classroom and the design of learning activities. Distance education, while originating with analog technologies such as the postal service and radio, television, or satellite broadcasts pivoted to digital technologies with the advent of networked computer technologies. Both origins of OE reflect the aspirations of their advocates to broaden access to formal education.

A challenge to modern open educators is reconciling the continuing emphasis on enacting social justice narratives with the attempt to do so in a digital landscape that is decidedly hostile, by design, to enacting social justice narratives. In the Canadian context, the most pressing need for justice is embodied in the lives and communities of the Indigenous Peoples who have stewarded this land since time immemorial. OE, which is often, but not always, digital, seems at first to be at odds with the traditional principles of learning practiced by Indigenous Peoples. Two examples of this, according to Tessaro et al. [\(2018\)](@tessaroFiveIndigenizingOnline2018) are that Indigenous Education is heavily dependent upon being situated in a specific community context at a specific time, conversely, open education is designed to transcend place and time and be accessible to anyone regardless of their location. Also, Indigenous Education should be carried out in a context where teachers are very attuned to their students personalities, histories, needs, and goals, but open educators may never meet or even speak to any given student, so there is little chance that they will be able to understand the contexts of their students.

The following table outlines some of the major points of conflict between Indigenous education and online education as described by Tessaro, et al. [\(2018\)](@tessaroFiveIndigenizingOnline2018) (Table 1). Note that they refer to *online* education, not *open* education, but the characteristics of online education they describe are also characteristic of modern open education, which relies heavily on online technologies. It is not true that online education and open education are the same thing, but a thorough discussion of the differences is beyond the scope of this paper.

| Indigenous education | Online Education |
| :--- | ---:|
| situated in a specific community | accessible across multiple communities  |
| highly contextual   | very low context  |
|experiential   | technologically mediated   |
|personal   | impersonal   |
|orally transmitted   | text-based  |

With such apparent contradictions in approaches to learning environments, it seems that open educators, despite their commitment to social justice, may have a very difficult time respectfully engaging with Indigenous Peoples in digital environments. A closer look, however, may tell a different story.


##### Open education

Open education is typically understood as being a set of beliefs, values, practices, and resources that, when enacted, increase access to educational environments for the benefit of marginalized or under-represented students. Educators who have surveyed the literature on the history of open education have found that early conceptions of open education were primarily focused on creating student-centred learning environments in K-12 (Cuban, 2004; Hendricks, 2017; Morgan, 2016) and, more specifically, three pairs of complementary values: "autonomy and interdependence; freedom and responsibility; democracy and participation" (Paquette, 2005). Morgan (2016) notes that these aims towards autonomy and freedom persist in the open education discourse today.

This paper will begin by briefly describing open education through three lenses: permissions, pedagogy, and participation.

###### Permissions

The dominant discourse in OE literature beginning with the 2002 UNESCO Forum on the Impact of Open Courseware for Higher Education [\(2002\)](@ForumImpactOpen2002) until 2012 focussed on the benefits of openness that can be realized through the creation and adoption of open educational resources (OER) [\(Lambert, 2018\)](@lambertChangingOurDis2018). OER are typically described as being educational resources such as books, articles, videos, lessons, courses, or other artifacts that are licensed to allow end users (teachers and students) to participate in 5 activities related to the resource. Users are permitted and encouraged to revise, remix, reuse, retain, and redistribute the materials [\(Wiley, ND\)](@wileyDefiningOpenOpenND).

Lambert [\(2018|)](@lambertChangingOurDis2018) describes this phase of the OE movement as being focussed on an aspirational narrative and that proponents were convinced *a priori* that 'openness' and 'access' are necessarily good. She challenges the assumption that simply providing free resources for all students will benefit all students.

###### Pedagogy

A second lens in the discourse could be called "pedagogy", "open pedagogy", or "open educational practices". The writers of the *Cape Town Open Education Declaration* wrote:

> However, open education is not limited to just open educational resources. It also draws upon open technologies that facilitate collaborative, flexible learning and the open sharing of teaching practices that empower educators to benefit from the best ideas of their colleagues. It may also grow to include new approaches to assessment, accreditation and collaborative learning. Understanding and embracing innovations like these is critical to the long term vision of this movement [\(2007, para. 4\)](@CapeTownOpen).

This vision of pedagogical innovation is seen in Wiley and Hilton's description of "OER-enabled pedagogy" as "the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER" [\(2018\)]()@wileyDefiningOEREnabledPedagogy2018). Paskevicius described OEP as:

> Teaching and learning practices where openness is enacted within all aspects of instructional practice; including the design of learning outcomes, the selection of teaching resources, and the planning of activities and assessment. OEP engage both faculty and students with the use and creation of OER, draw attention to the potential afforded by open licences, facilitate open peer-review, and support participatory student-directed projects [\(2017, p. 127\)](@paskeviciusConceptualizingOpenEducational2017).

Other researchers describe OE as "resources, tools and practices to improve educational access, effectiveness, and equality worldwide" [\(Cronin & MacLaren, 2018, p. 127\)](@croninConceptualisingOEPReview2018.). It is notable that Cronin and MacLaren's definition does not specifically mention the use of open licenses or OER while Paskevicius' definition is specific about the use and creation of OER coupled with innovative pedagogies that are enabled by open licenses.

###### Participation

More recently, researchers have published papers critical of the aspirational narrative around open education being focussed on issues of social justice for marginalized groups. If marginalized groups (such as Indigenous people living in remote communities in northern Canada) have more difficulty accessing stable broadband internet, then the digital environment of most OE programming, regardless of whether it is pedagogically innovative, will only benefit those who do have stable access to broadband internet and inequality will increase. This digital divide is suggested by the results of Rohs and Ganz's investigation of massive open online courses (MOOCs) [\(2015\)](@rohsMOOCsClaimEducation2015). They found that participation in two different MOOCs was weighted towards people who already had obtained some level of higher education suggesting that MOOC participants were more likely to not be from a marginalized group.

  - Learning ultimately supports the well-being of the self, the family, the community, the land, the spirits, and the ancestors.
  - Learning is holistic, reflexive, reflective, experiential, and relational (focused on connectedness, on reciprocal relationships, and a sense of place).
  - Learning involves recognizing the consequences of one’s actions.

  - Learning recognizes the role of indigenous knowledge.
  - Learning is embedded in memory, history, and story.
  - Learning involves patience and time.
  - Learning requires exploration of one’s identity.
