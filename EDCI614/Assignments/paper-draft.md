### First People's Principles of learning.
- Learning ultimately supports the well-being of the self, the family, the community, the land, the spirits, and the ancestors.
- Learning is holistic, reflexive, reflective, experiential, and relational (focused on connectedness, on reciprocal relationships, and a sense of place).
- Learning involves recognizing the consequences of one’s actions.
- Learning involves generational roles and responsibilities.
- Learning recognizes the role of indigenous knowledge.
- Learning is embedded in memory, history, and story.
- Learning involves patience and time.
- Learning requires exploration of one’s identity.
- Learning involves recognizing that some knowledge is sacred and only shared with permission and/or in certain situations.

# Seeing Open Education with Two Eyes

Open education (OE) has a relatively short history compared to other educational ideas, but it is a history rich with aspirations about democratizing education, increasing student voice, reducing barriers to formal learning opportunities, and promoting justice for marginalized groups and individuals. A citation analysis published by Weller, Jordan, DeVries, and Rolfe, (2018), showed the earliest roots of OE literature to be in both the 'open classroom' movement in the 1970s and in the distance education literature beginning in the 1980s. The open classroom movement originated in the UK following the Plowden report [\(Plowden, 1967\)](@plowdenChildrenTheirPrimary1967), which argued for a student-centred model of education with *open* referring to the physical space of a classroom and the design of learning activities. Distance education, while originating with analog technologies such as the postal service and radio, television, or satellite broadcasts pivoted to digital technologies with the advent of networked computer technologies. Both origins of OE reflect the aspirations of their advocates to broaden access to formal education.

A challenge to modern open educators is reconciling the continuing emphasis on enacting social justice narratives with the attempt to do so in a digital landscape that is decidedly hostile, by design, to enacting social justice narratives. In the Canadian context, the most pressing need for justice is embodied in the lives and communities of the Indigenous Peoples who have stewarded this land since time immemorial. OE, which is often, but not always, digital, seems at first to be at odds with the traditional principles of learning practiced by Indigenous Peoples. Two examples of this, according to Tessaro et al. [\(2018\)](@tessaroFiveIndigenizingOnline2018) are that Indigenous Education is heavily dependent upon being situated in a specific community context at a specific time, conversely, open education is designed to transcend place and time and be accessible to anyone regardless of their location. Also, Indigenous Education should be carried out in a context where teachers are very attuned to their students personalities, histories, needs, and goals, but open educators may never meet or even speak to any given student, so there is little chance that they will be able to understand the contexts of their students.

The following table outlines some of the major points of conflict between Indigenous education and online education as described by Tessaro, et al. [\(2018\)](@tessaroFiveIndigenizingOnline2018) (Table 1). Note that they refer to *online* education, not *open* education, but the characteristics of online education they describe are also characteristic of modern open education, which relies heavily on online technologies. It is not true that online education and open education are the same thing, but a thorough discussion to the differences is beyond the scope of this paper.

| Indigenous education | Online Education |
| :--- | ---:|
| situated in a specific community | accessible across multiple communities  |
| highly contextual   | very low context  |
|experiential   | technologically mediated   |
|personal   | impersonal   |
|orally transmitted   | text-based  |
_Table 1. Points of conflict between Indigenous and Open Education_

With such apparent contradictions in approaches to learning environments, it seems that open educators, despite their commitment to social justice, may have a very difficult time respectfully engaging with Indigenous Peoples in digital environments. A closer look, however, may tell a different story.

### Defining Terms

Before proceeding with a closer analysis, it is important to clarify what is meant by the language used in this paper.

##### Open education

Educators who have surveyed the literature on the history of open education have found that early conceptions of open education were primarily focused on creating student-centred learning environments in K-12 (Cuban, 2004; Hendricks, 2017; Morgan, 2016) and, more specifically, three pairs of complementary values: "autonomy and interdependence; freedom and responsibility; democracy and participation" (Paquette, 2005). Morgan (2016) notes that these aims towards autonomy and freedom persist in the open education literature today.

This paper will begin by describing open education through three lenses: permissions, pedagogy, and participation.

###### Permissions

The dominant discourse in OE literature between approximately 2002 and 2017 has focussed on the benefits of openness that can be realized through the creation and adoption of open educational resources (OER) [\(Lambert, 2018\)](@lambertChangingOurDis2018). OER are typically described as being educational resources such as books, articles, videos, lessons, courses, or other artifacts that are licensed to allow end users to participate in 5 activities related to the resource. Users are permitted and encouraged to revise, remix, reuse, retain, and redistribute the materials [\(Wiley, ND\)](@wileyDefiningOpenOpenND).

Lambert [\(2018|)](@lambertChangingOurDis2018) describes this phase of the OE movement as being overly focussed on an aspirational narrative convinced *a priori* that 'openness' and 'access' are necessarily good. She challenges the assumption that simply providing free resources for all students will benefit all students.

###### Pedagogy

Inviting participation in OE environments can be a good first step towards opening education, but it is important that the invitation is not to participate in a poorly designed or taught experience. The Cape Town declaration doesn't stop at inviting participation; the authors specify that OE ought to lead to pedagogical advancement in that it should lead to "new approaches to assessment, accreditation and collaborative learning"


This is echoed in Wiley and Hilton's description of "OER-enabled pedagogy" as "the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER." [\(2018\)]()@wileyDefiningOEREnabledPedagogy2018)

###### Participation

In 2007, a small group of open educators met in Cape Town, South Africa and published the _Cape Town Open Education Declaration_ in which they argue that open education can increase access to education and also "nourish [a] participatory culture of learning"  ("The Cape Town Open Education Declaration," n.d. para. 3-4). The Cape Town Declaration has become one of the most important documents in the open education movement and it forms the foundation of others who aspire to increase access, or invite participation, to higher education. More recently, Paskevicius described open education practices as "support[ing] participatory student-directed projects" [\(2017, p. 127\)](@paskeviciusConceptualizingOpenEducational2017) and Cronin and MacLaren describe OE as "resources, tools and practices to improve educational access, effectiveness, and equality worldwide" [\(2018, p. 127\)](@croninConceptualisingOEPReview2018.).

Participation in OE environments means that potential students have both greater access to education (participation), and that they have a more significant "voice" in the process of education (democracy).
