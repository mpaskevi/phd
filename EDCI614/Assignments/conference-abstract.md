### Mapping Openness in Education

The term *open education* and its synonyms have come to mean a wide variety of things depending on the context. To some, it reflects a commitment to social justice in and access to higher education; to others, it is about using openly licensed materials to reduce student costs; and still others see it as a set of pedagogies that utilize the open education resources to improve learning outcomes. The lack of consistency in definitions has the potential to lead to reduced clarity and precision in research in the field. This presentation attempts to map the primary definitions of open education in the literature in order to provide clarity and suggest a common foundation of terminology. Rather than seeking a single definitive description, I will argue that there is a multi-dimensional spectrum of beliefs, artifacts, and practices which compose the field of open education. This diversity grows out of the roots of open education as a multi-disciplinary endeavour initiated and developed by faculty and administrators who share a common set of values about improving access to and the quality of higher education.
