Yesterday, [@cogdog](https://twitter.com/cogdog) blogged a [request](http://cogdogblog.com/2018/06/interviewing-your-domain/) on behalf of #OntarioExtend asking for those who own their own domains to write a short blog post about their experiences. Here we go...

===

Q1. What is your domain name and what is the story, meaning behind your choice of that as a name?

I have two domains right now, and several sub-domains. The first domain that I created was [merelearning.ca](http://merelearning.ca). I chose that name to reflect my desire to blog about learning and to do so without becoming an 'ed-tech solutionist' or a hype evangelist for the 'next big idea that will revolutionize education'. As a faculty developer, I'm interested in 'what works' in education. It is also a nod to [CS Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_Christianity), although I don't tend to write much about my faith there.

More recently, I purchased the domain [madland.ca](https://madland.ca), but let it sit vacant for a long time, not wanting anyone else to purchase it before I had plans to do something with it. As you can see from the link above and from this blog, I have installed a couple of instances of [Grav](https://getgrav.org) here. The meaning behind choosing this domain is that it is my last name.

Both my domains have '.ca' as the top-level domain, because I am Canadian, although I have looked briefly at purchasing both merelearning.io and madland.io so that I can look like one of the cool techy kids.
