Well, 'meeting' #1 of my PhD journey is done! As this is a seminar course focussed more on empowerment and conversation, our prof likes to call our weekly get-togethers 'meetings'. Ok.

As is standard in the first introduction to a course, there was the typical conversation about the course outline and where we would be headed and such things....

===

One of the key points of the meeting was the nature of a concept, and the concept we used as a first example was  'culture'. So in our little groups, we were tasked with analyzing the concept of culture.

1. Definition: a group of people with a shared way of living
2. etymology: we talked about how the word 'cult' (the old definition) gives a clue that there is a sense that a particular group of people are differentiated from another group of people in some meaningful way.
3. Examples: grad students, schools, nations, etc.
4. non-examples: individuals, non-living objects, artifacts generated by cultures
5. Essential features: shared way of living
6. accidental features: history, art, values, religion, spirituality, etc.

The point of this first exercise wasn't to determine a correct and complete analysis of the concept of culture, but to practice thinking about culture in a systematic way.

The real task is our first assignment, to analyze a concept related to our research interests. This post is a first go at analyzing the concept of 'open', at least as it relates to education.

I'll work through the steps of the analysis as outlined above on my own, then I 'll go back and consult some resources.

## Open
>> as related to education

#### Definition
'Open' is a system of beliefs and practices that seek to enable increased access (the capacity and the power to participate) to learning by reducing or eliminating barriers such as cost, geographic distance, institutional policies, and systems of oppression.

#### Etymology
This is a difficult question for me to answer without outside assistance. I just don't know the history of the word itself.

#### Examples
- Use of open education resources (OER) to reduce the cost of materials for students.
- adopting policies that reduce or eliminate course and program prerequisites
- providing specialized support for marginalized individuals
- providing multiple avenues of access to learning environments for those who cannot travel to campus
- providing opportunity for student work to be exposed to 'the public'.

#### Non-Examples
- So-called 'inclusive access' deals between publishers and bookstores which may lower one barrier, such as cost, but which erect other barriers, such as rental books that are only accessible for the duration of the semester
- zero-tolerance course policies for adult learners who have busy lives and careers outside of school
- reliance on standardized test scores for determining eligibility for university admissions

#### Essential Features
- lead to increased access without negatively affecting learning outcomes

#### Accidental Features
- open licenses
- free materials
