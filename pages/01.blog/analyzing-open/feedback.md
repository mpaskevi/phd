 Hi Colin:
Yes, you are on the right track with this assignment. With this base established, I can see that explaining the context in which this concept sits and how/why it is important to do this analysis will go a long way toward making your ongoing work more comprehensive in detail and hence powerful. You have already taken a first step in this direction by stating “open – in the context of education” – you could still say more about how this is therefore not “open for business” or “opening an envelope” (just as two ideas that I can think of quickly).
From here it would be good to explicitly state how “as it applies to education” works in some more detail. What made some instances of education either “closed” or in need of greater openness”?
I think that defining it as a “system of beliefs” is headed in the right direction, although I will encourage you to think that it is more a result or outcome of a certain system of beliefs, rather than the system itself. For example, “open” is congruent with a belief in inclusive education for the good of all, but not with a hard-nosed social Darwinism.
It is also good to see you differentiating what you mean by openness (and what is closer to a true or authentic openness – although we in the academy are always wary of claims to absolute truth and authenticity) from abuses of the term. For instance, I am aware that some academic journals are truly open access in that they are available to all for free, while others claim to be open access but in fact charge authors for the privilege of opening their article to the public in this way. Perhaps you could speak more to phenomena like this earlier in the analysis when setting the context, in order to show the reader why it is important to be doing this work in the first place!
I hope this helps! Once again, this is a solid start, and I look forward to seeing how you develop it further.
As for posting this assignment on a blog, I have not seen students do this before. I would recommend sending me your work privately instead, so that this way you can publish the best, finished product that has had the benefit of moving through several drafts and receiving some formative assessment.
See you Monday, G

Thank you Graham!

I really enjoyed our first meeting and am very much looking forward to the course!
You may have gathered from my self-intro that I am interested in researching open education. I am also committed to practicing openness in my teaching practice and research, and therefore I have created a website at grav.madland.ca where I intend to process my learning and test out draft assignment ideas.
I’ve posted one preliminary take on the concept analysis assignment at grav.madland.ca/analyzing-open. It’s simply a rumination and I haven’t added any sources yet.
This brings up two questions in my mind:
1. Is this appropriate in your mind with respect to academic integrity, knowing that these posts would be open to my colleagues?
2. Am I on the right track with the assignment?
Thanks very much! Colin
