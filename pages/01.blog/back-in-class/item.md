Tonight marks the fourth meeting of our class exploring discourses in education at UVic. We are a fairly small class or 14 new PhD and 3 MEd students who meet for 3 hours per week. We are a diverse group with people from Tanzania, Nigeria, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, and Canada. Many of the group have moved themselves and their families from farr-off places to study in Victoria, and at least one is still unsure about being able to secure a study visa. It's an expensive prospect.

===

It's that expense that has me interested right now. Moving a family with kids to another continent is massively disruptive (I've done it...).
