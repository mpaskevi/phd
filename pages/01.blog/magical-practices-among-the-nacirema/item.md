The first reading for week 3 of EDCI 614 is 

!!! Miner, H. (2012). Magical practices among the Nacirema. In D. J. Hodges, The anthropology of education : classic readings.

After the break are some questions provided to guide our thinking as we read the article...

===

1. Have you ever met a Nacirema?
2. What effect does Miner achieve by using the word magic?
3. What does “magic-ridden people” suggest?
4. Is the researcher an insider or an outsider? What advantage does this status give the analysis?
5. Consider the following quotation:
“While the natives are very vague on this point we can only assume that the idea in retaining all the old magical materials is that their presence in the charm box, before which the body rituals are conducted, will in some way protect the worshipper” (Page 6, paragraph 3)
Is Miner’s analysis correct?
6. How does this article affect the way I view myself as a professional?
