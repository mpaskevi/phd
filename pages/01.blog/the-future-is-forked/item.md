It's been a while since David Wiley first talked about the reusability paradox which basically posits that the more detailed and localized a particular resource is, the harder it will be for others to use it. And the more a particular resource is designed to be shared, the less useful it will be.
===
The paradox was particularly potent when repositories were filled with copyrighted materials that couldn't be edited. Wiley's solution to the reusability paradox is creative commons licensing which allows every potential user to revise the materials and use them in their own context.

Now, as more people are applying CC licenses to their work, there is a growing awareness that CC materials can be copied, revised, and reused in local contexts. Unfortunately, these materials are too often shared in formats that are next to impossible to revise.

A good example is a PDF. The material may be CC licensed, but since they are displayed in a proprietary format, if someone wants to remix the material, they need to copypasta into their own document before they can make any changes. This may not seem to be onerous as it's just a few taps of the trackpad to make it happen. But what usually happens is that if you copy from pdf and paste into Werd, all of the line breaks from the PDF will be preserved meaning that the user will have to engage in significant formatting work before they can make changes. And if there are fonts that the user doesn't have on their computer, they will be replaced, resulting in further formatting irregularities.

The process gets a little easier if the original file is a Werd file, as that can be edited directly and saved as a copy. But that brings up another difficulty. The second version is completely disconnected from the original. Someone reading the second version will have no idea what the original said, unless the two files are presented together.

It gets more difficult again if the user wants to remix a file but it is in a format that they can't edit at all. Think of a file that might be created in Adobe InDesign or MS Publisher. Since fewer people have access to that software, the materials are even less accessible.

#### A Better Way

Now imagine that the original materials are in a format that is designed for sharing and collaborating.

What would the characteristics of the most shareable document have? Here are some thoughts.

1. The text of the materials would be in the simplest format possible. Fonts would be irrelevant, breaks wouldn't exist, formatting would be a simple as possible.
2. Revisions would be non-destructive, leaving the original file intact.
3. Revisions would maintain a connection to the original, allowing others to compare versions and see what has changed.
