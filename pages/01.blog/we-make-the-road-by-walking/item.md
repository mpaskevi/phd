The next several years of my life are going to be filled with more writing than I have done in a long time. Actually more than I have ever done. So, in an attempt to begin to get into a rhythm of writing and thinking, and thinking by writing, and writing while I read, here we go. Last night, I ordered *We Make the Road by Walking: Conversations on Education and Social Change* featuring Myles Horton and Paulo Friere 'talking a book' in 1987. 

===

I think that the title of the book is appropriate given the PhD journey I'm about to begin. *We Make the Road by Walking*, and it's a conversation about education and social change between two of the most influential educators of their time.

I recognize that it is a rare priveledge to be able to study towards a PhD, even to study at all is hardly common in many parts of the world, and that is something that troubles me. We know that education is the surest path out of poverty, and we also know that poverty is among the chief causes of lack of achievement in education.
