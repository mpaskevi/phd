> Conference Proposalâ€”30%
The format for this assignment is roughly similar to the [Conference Abstract](http://grav.madland.ca/blog/conference-abstract-submitted) assignment, except that it offers you more space and hence the opportunity to provide a degree of greater detail regarding what you imagine you might present.
Length: 3 pages double-spaced (maximum), excluding works cited

### A (Brief) History of Open Education

Audrey Watters (hackeducation.com, n.d.) often reminds her readers that we ignore the history of educational technology at our own peril. Her point is that the historical foundations of ideas and artifacts are important in interrogating modern trends. I argue that the same is true when thinking about *open education*. Lack of clarity or precision about what is meant by open education leads to difficulty for researchers and educators, and we might be well-served to explore the history of the concept.

Educators who have surveyed the literature on the history of open education (Hendricks, 2017; Morgan, 2016) have found that early conceptions of open education were primarily focused on creating student-centred learning environments in K-12 (Cuban, 2004) or more specifically "autonomy and interdependence; freedom and responsibility; democracy and participation" (Paquette, 2005, *trans.*). Morgan notes that there are distinct similarities between what Paquette advocated as far back as 1979 and that to which open educators currently aspire, such as: student choice and autonomy, connectedness, access, and student voice to name a few.

#### Cape Town Open Education Declaration

In 2007 a small group of open educators met in Cape Town, South Africa and published the *Cape Town Open Education Declaration* which provides a clear description of their vision of the potential of open education as enabled by openly licensed materials. They wrote:

>The expanding global collection of open educational resources has created fertile ground for this effort. These resources include openly licensed course materials, lesson plans, textbooks, games, software and other materials that support teaching and learning. They contribute to making education more accessible, especially where money for learning materials is scarce. They also nourish the kind of participatory culture of learning, creating, sharing and cooperation that rapidly changing knowledge societies need. @CapeTownOpen, Para. 3

Clearly, early official statements regarding open education were focussed not only on the fact of open licenses, but possibly moreso on the fact that open resources can reduce costs for students and build a culture of highly effective learning environments.

The writers of the declaration go on to state:

>However, open education is not limited to just open educational resources. It also draws upon open technologies that facilitate collaborative, flexible learning and the open sharing of teaching practices that empower educators to benefit from the best ideas of their colleagues. It may also grow to include new approaches to assessment, accreditation and collaborative learning. Understanding and embracing innovations like these is critical to the long term vision of this movement. @CapeTownOpen, Para. 4

#### Open Education Resources (OER)

In 2012, the provincial government of British Columbia announced funding for the creation of openly licensed textbooks for the 40 highest enrolment courses in BC post-secondary institutions. The project was to be stewarded by BCcampus. Since then, the BCcampus Open Textbook Repository has grown to over 200 open textbooks and other resources as provincial funding has expanded.

The defining characteristic of OER is that they are released under an open license, usually a Creative Commons license which empowers end users to engage in five activities with materials (retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute), collectively known as the "5R permissions" or "the 5Rs" @wileyDefiningOpenOpenND.

The Open Textbook project in BC was not the first open education initiative in BC, but it has arguably had the most influence. With this influx of government funding and support for the creation, adaptation, and adoption of open textbooks, it is understandable that the focus in Western Canada initially was on open education being primarily about reducing student costs. Other high profile initiatives in North America include the OpenStax project at Rice University, Saylor Academy, Lumen Learning and several institutions who have partnered with the Open Education Resources universitas (OERu).

There is a small, but growing, body of literature on the topic of the effects of the adoption of open textbooks in higher education. Much of the literature is focussed on the effect of open textbooks on Costs, Outcomes, Uses, and Perceptions (COUP) related to the use of open textbooks.

#### OER-enabled Pedagogies

David Wiley has been a tireless champion for the use of OER and open textbooks in higher education for many years. He is the chief steward and host of the Open Education Conference held each year and writes extensively on the topic. In 2017, David noticed that there were many instances of people using the term "open education" to mean different things and it was becoming difficult to speak or write meaningfully about it without causing confusion. Wiley's response to this was to coin a term that he hadn't previously seen in the literature so that he could be clear about what he meant. He chose to use the term "OER-enabled pedagogy" to refer to what he called:

> the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER. (Wiley, 2018, @wileyDefiningOEREnabledPedagogy2018).

Wiley's definition serves to move the emphasis from cost-savings for students to the unique ways that OER can be used by educators to engage their students. He is clear in his focus only on those activities that are enabled by open licenses and the 5R permissions. Consequently, OER-enabled pedagogies should be considered as a subset of open pedagogies.

#### Open Education Practices (OEP)

Open education practice (OEP) is a more recent construct than open education, with early descriptions beginning to appear in the literature in 2007 (Cronin & Maclaren, 2018). Cronin and MacLaren argue for an expansive view of OEP based on the history of the concept in the literature. They highlight four key initiatives that have influenced much of the subsequent literature.

Characteristics of OEP that they found included the empowerment of students in constructing knowledge (@geserOpenEducationalPractices, @ehlersOpenEducationalPractices2010), innovative pedagogies, use and sharing of open resources, public pedagogies, alternative forms of assessment and accreditation, the use of open technologies @hbeethamOpenPracticesBriefing2012 @hodgkinson-williamscherylDegreesEaseAdoption2014, and a general aim to improve the quality of learning in higher education.

Paskevicius (2017) used the framework of constructive alignment (biggs) to suggest a working definition of OEP as:

> Teaching and learning practices where openness is enacted within all aspects of instructional practice; including the design of learning outcomes, the selection of teaching resources, and the planning of activities and assessment. OEP engage both faculty and students with the use and creation of OER, draw attention to the potential afforded by open licences (sic), facilitate open peer-review, and support participatory student-directed projects.

### Moving Forward

- inviting and empowering participation in high quality learning environments through the use of open education resources, policies that reduce barriers to participation, open pedagogies, interoperable technology systems and tools,


- invitation to contribute to a learning community
- *personalization, connectedness, openness (in terms of OER, etc.), assessment (for learning), and access (multi-access) (Irvine, unpublished)*
