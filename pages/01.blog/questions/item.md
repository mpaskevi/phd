By this time next year, I need to have zeroed in on a research agenda for this PhD.

Here are my thoughts as of now...

===

This post will hopefully be recognizable in the final accounting of my degree, but I know that it won't be all that close to it. Such is the nature of spreading a degree over several years.

When I think about the most pressing issues, in my mind at least, in Canadian higher ed today, there are a few that come to mind, and they seem to fall into two general categories:

#### Access

1. The recommendations of the [Truth and Reconciliation Commission](www.trc.ca):

!!! We call upon the federal government to develop with Aboriginal groups a joint strategy to eliminate educational and employment gaps between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.

!!! We call upon the federal government to provide adequate funding to end the backlog of First Nations students seeking a post-secondary education.
2. The cost of textbooks.
8. The geographical barriers to participation in higher ed in Canada.

#### Digital Literacy
1. The need to prepare K12 teacher candidates to use technology well in their teaching practice.
5. The pressure on higher ed faculty and k12 teachers to integrate technology into their classroom without sufficient support in how to do so in a pedagogically beneficial way.
6. The increasing polarization of Canadians along political lines driven by digital media.

Obviously this isn't an exhaustive list of all the things that concern me and it seems that the two categories are a little unrelated. But, to me, they are related.

Access to higher ed is an issue for Indigenous students for many reasons, and some ways that barriers can be reduced is through the creation and adoption of [open textbooks](open.bccampus.ca), the use of pedagogies uniquely enabled by open resources, and technology-enhanced methods of scaffolding access to learning environments. So, in short, technology and digital pedagogies can increase access to formal educational environments, but K12 teachers and HE faculty need to learn how to use technology to do that.
