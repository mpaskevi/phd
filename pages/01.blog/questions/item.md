By this time next year, I need to have zeroed in on a research agenda for this PhD.

Here are my thoughts as of now...

===

This post will hopefully be recognizable in the final accounting of my degree, but I know that it won't be all that close to it. Such is the nature of spreading a degree over several years.

When I think about the most pressing issues, in my mind at least, in Canadian higher ed today, there are a few that come to mind:

1. The pressure on higher ed faculty and k12 teachers to integrate technology into their classroom without sufficient support in how to do so in a pedagogically beneficial way.
2. The geographical barriers to participation in higher ed in Canada.
3. The cost of textbooks.
3. The recommendations of the [Truth and Reconciliation Commission](www.trc.ca):
!!! We call upon the federal government to develop with Aboriginal groups a joint strategy to eliminate educational and employment gaps between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.
!!! We call upon the federal government to provide adequate funding to end the backlog of First Nations students seeking a post-secondary education.
4. Changes in age demographics and the accompanying decline in enrolments.
5. The increasing polarization of Canadians along political lines driven by digital media.
