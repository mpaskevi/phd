I'm a few weeks into my second course in my program, this one being Advanced Research Methods. the topic du jour this last week was about crafting research questions. Here are some exercises we've gone through this week.

===

##### Using only one-or two-word responses, write down the answers to the following questions:
- What is your topic?
  - open and networked learning
- What is the context for your research?
  - Indigenous education
- What do you want to achieve?
  - discover how Indigenous learners participate in networked and open education
- What is the nature of your question?
  - how and why
- Are there any potential relationships you want to explore?
  - how does the platform influence what students do?
##### Starting with the nature of the question, i.e. who, what where how when, begin to piece together the answers generated in step 1 until you feel comfortable with the eventual question or questions.
Possible Question a)
- how do Indigenous students participate in open and networked learning
Possible Question b)
- Which learning designs maximize learning for Indigenous students in open and networked learning environments?
Possible Question c)
-
3. If you have developed more than one question, decide on your main question
based on interest and practicalities.
4. Narrow and clarify until your question is as concise and well articulated as
possible.
