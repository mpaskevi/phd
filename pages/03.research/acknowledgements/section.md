This section, which may be omitted, should be a brief acknowledgement of assistance given to the candidate in the preparation of the thesis/dissertation. It is numbered amongst the Preliminary Pages (i.e. small Roman numerals) and included in the Table of Contents.

If included it is usually a maximum of one page.

If not including an Acknowledgments section then delete:
- the Acknowledgment title,
- the notes on this page and the [] brackets,
- any empty paragraph marks,
- and the page break below or you will have a blank page that throws off the page numbers in the Table of Contents.
