# Welcome!

I'm a PhD student in educational technology at the University of Victoria on the beautiful southern tip of Vancouver Island in British Colulmbia. By day, I'm the Manager of Online Learning and Instructional Technology at Trinity Western University in Langley, BC.

I'll be using this site to narrate my thinking.

### Grav
The front end of this site is arranged and displayed in [Grav](https://getgrav.org) using [Paul Hibbitts' Open Publishing Space Grav Skeleton](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-open-publishing-quark/). Paul provides a boatload of sample pages, so you might see some stray stuff from Paul or a demo for a while, but I'll get it cleaned up in time.

### GitHub
The backend content lives in [GitHub](https://github.com/cmadland/phd), where, if you're interested, you can have a look at the structure of it all.
