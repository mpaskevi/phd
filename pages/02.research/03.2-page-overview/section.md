### Topic

Networked and Open Education Practices in Indigenous Contexts

### Problem

A challenge to modern open educators is reconciling the continuing emphasis on enacting social justice narratives with the attempt to do so in a digital landscape that is, at times, hostile to enacting social justice narratives. In the Canadian context, one of the most pressing needs for justice is embodied in the lives and communities of the Indigenous Peoples who have stewarded this land since time immemorial. OE, which is often, but not always, digital, seems at first to be at odds with the traditional principles of learning practiced by Indigenous Peoples. Two examples of this, according to Tessaro et al. (2018) are that Indigenous education is heavily dependent upon being situated in a specific community context at a specific time, conversely; open education is designed to transcend place and time and be accessible to anyone regardless of their location. Also, Indigenous education should be carried out in a context where teachers are very attuned to their students personalities, histories, needs, and goals, but open educators may never meet or even speak to any given student, so there is little chance that they will be able to understand the contexts of their students.

### Purpose Statement

The purpose of this research is to identify ways for Canadian universities use networked and open technologies to address the backlog of Indigenous students who have difficulty accessing higher education due to their geographic remoteness. A secondary purpose is to promote reconciliation between Indigenous and settler communities through participation in higher education.

### Research Questions
1. What do Indigenous students in remote communities in Canada think about accessing networked or open education?
2. Can the 5R's of Indigenous education be realized in networked and open learning environments?
3. How can non-Indigenous open educators promote reconciliation in their practice?
