### Topic

- Design of open learning environments for Indigenous learning

### Problem

- incommensurability between the ethos of technology (surveillance capitalism) and ethos of Indigenous communities and ways of knowing
- aspirational narrative in Canada that open education is bent towards social justice
  - do we have evidence that this is actually happening?

### Purpose

- to examine the suitability of using digital technologies and open education practices to respond to the TRC Calls to Action
- to determine how open educators can respectfully invite Indigenous learners to engage with digital technologies and open education practices to increase access to high-quality learning environments

### Question(s)

- What role do non-Indigenous open educators have in responding to the TRC Calls to Action?
- do OEP increase access to higher education for Indigenous learners
