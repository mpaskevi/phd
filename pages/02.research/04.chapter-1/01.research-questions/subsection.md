Super Tentative, first draft.

!!! See: [https://bit.ly/gitpitch-oe](https://bit.ly/gitpitch-oe)

### Topic

- Design of open learning environments for Indigenous learning

### Problem

- incommensurability between the ethos of technology (surveillance capitalism) and ethos of Indigenous communities and ways of knowing
  - indigenous communities already a small voice; how do we amplify indigenous voices? should we amplify indigenous voices?
- aspirational narrative in Canada that open education is bent towards social justice
  - do we have evidence that this is actually happening?

### Purpose

- to examine the suitability of using digital technologies and open education practices to respond to the TRC Calls to Action
- to determine how open educators can respectfully invite Indigenous learners to engage with digital technologies and open education practices to increase access to high-quality learning environments

### Question(s)

- What role do non-Indigenous open educators have in responding to the TRC Calls to Action?
- do OEP increase access to higher education for Indigenous learners

#### Thoughts

- UN Millenium development goals open education - Nathan Lane
- Weller on risks of open ed
- veletsianos on faculty in the open
- what ways can people who choose not to, or should not, be open on the internet, participate in the 'affordances' of open education?
  - giving back to community (reciprocity)
