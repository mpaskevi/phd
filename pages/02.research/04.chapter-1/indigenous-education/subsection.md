  (Tessaro, et al, 2017)

#### Learning is connected to land, culture, and spirit.
We—the two-legged, four-legged, finned and feathered, plants and rocks —are all related.
We must always practice reciprocity through acts of giving and receiving.

#### Learning honours our Ancestors, Elders, Knowledge Keepers and Descendents.
It respects and embraces ceremony, protocol, and teachings that are connected to the sacred medicines including tobacco, cedar, sage, and sweetgrass.
Important teachings emerge through stories.

#### Learning involves developing relationships, respecting distinct cultures, and honouring the perspective of others in our communities.
The deepest learning takes place through lived experience. It requires exploring our identities, learning from our mistakes, and having gratitude for our gifts.

#### Learning is a journey that takes courage, patience and humility.
It is about striving to become a better human being and living with balance in body, mind, heart and spirit.
