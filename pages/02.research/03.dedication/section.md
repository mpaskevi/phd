This optional page, if it is included, follows the Acknowledgment, is numbered amongst the Preliminary Pages (i.e. small Roman numerals), and is listed in the Table of Contents.

This gives the opportunity to honour those who have inspired you to undertake the thesis.

If included it is usually a maximum of one page.

If not including a Dedication section then delete:
the Dedication title
the notes on this page and the [ ] brackets,
any empty paragraph marks,
and the page break below
or you will have a blank page that throws off the page numbers in the Table of Contents.

To see the page break and paragraph marks, select the Show/Hide button on the Standard toolbar. It is usually next to the 100% Zoom tool or use the keyboard shortcut
Control + Shift + * to toggle the Show/Hide display on and off.
