## Conclusion

Returning to table 1, it would seem the superficially apparent conflicts between Indigenous education and online education could be more accurately understood as conflicts between Indigenous education and for-profit networked technologies designed to be extractive or between Indigenous education and out-dated didactic pedagogies employed widely in online and face-to-face education historically and presently. Indigenization, decolonization, and reconciliation are critically important and equally difficult. At the foundation of the work of open education should be Freire's admonition in _Pedagogy of the Oppressed_:

True solidarity with the oppressed means fighting at their side to transform the objective reality which has made them these 'beings for another'. The oppressor is solidary with the oppressed only when he stops regarding the oppressed as an abstract category and sees them as persons who have been unjustly dealt with, deprived of their voice, cheated in the sale of their labour â€“ when he stops making pious, sentimental and individualistic gestures and risks an act of love, in its existentiality, in its praxis. To affirm that men and women are persons and as persons should be free, and yet do nothing tangible to make this affirmation a reality, is a farce. (Freire, 2018, p. 54)
