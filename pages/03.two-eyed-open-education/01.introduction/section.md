### Indigenous and Open Education: A Contradiction?

Open education (OE) has a relatively short history compared to other educational constructs, but it is a history rich with aspirations about democratizing education, increasing student voice, reducing barriers to formal learning opportunities, and promoting justice for marginalized groups and individuals (UNESCO, 2002). A citation analysis published by Weller, Jordan, DeVries, and Rolfe (2018) showed some of the earliest roots of OE literature to be in both the 'open classroom' movement in the 1970s and in the distance education literature beginning in the 1980s. The open classroom movement originated in the UK following the Plowden report (Plowden, 1967), which argued for a student-centred model of education with _open_ referring to the physical space of a classroom and the design of learning activities. Distance education, while originating with analog technologies such as the postal service and radio, television, or satellite broadcasts pivoted to digital technologies with the advent of networked computer technologies. Both origins of OE reflect the aspirations of their advocates to broaden access to formal education.

A challenge to modern open educators is reconciling the continuing emphasis on enacting social justice narratives with the attempt to do so in a digital landscape that is, at times, hostile to enacting social justice narratives. In the Canadian context, one of the most pressing needs for justice is embodied in the lives and communities of the Indigenous Peoples who have stewarded this land since time immemorial. OE, which is often, but not always, digital, seems at first to be at odds with the traditional principles of learning practiced by Indigenous Peoples. Two examples of this, according to Tessaro et al. (2018) are that Indigenous education is heavily dependent upon being situated in a specific community context at a specific time, conversely; open education is designed to transcend place and time and be accessible to anyone regardless of their location. Also, Indigenous education should be carried out in a context where teachers are very attuned to their students personalities, histories, needs, and goals, but open educators may never meet or even speak to any given student, so there is little chance that they will be able to understand the contexts of their students.

The following table outlines some of the major points of conflict between Indigenous education and online education as described by Tessaro, et al. (2018) (Table 1). Note that they refer to _online_ education, not _open_ education, but the characteristics of online education they describe are also characteristic of modern open education, which relies heavily on online networked technologies. It is not true that online education and open education are the same thing, but a thorough discussion of the differences is beyond the scope of this paper.

| Indigenous education| Online Education |
| --- | --- |
| situated in a specific community | accessible across multiple communities |
| highly contextual | very low context |
| experiential | technologically mediated |
| personal | impersonal |
| orally transmitted | text-based (implied in original) |

With such apparent contradictions in approaches to learning environments, it seems that open educators, despite their commitment to social justice, may have a very difficult time respectfully engaging with Indigenous Peoples in digital environments. A closer look, however, may tell a different story. This paper will argue that the principles of Indigenous education are actually closely aligned with the principles of networked open education, but that this alignment may be undermined by the use of some commercial digitally networked tools.
