Open education has a relatively short history compared to other educational ideas, but it is a history rich with aspirations about democratizing education, increasing student voice, reducing barriers to formal learning opportunities, and promoting justice for marginalized groups and individuals. A citation analysis published by Weller, Jordan, DeVries, and Rolfe, (2018), showed the earliest roots of open education literature to be in both the 'open classroom' movement in the 1970s and in the distance education literature beginning in the 1980s.
