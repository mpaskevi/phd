### Abstract
Open education narratives often emphasize increasing access to higher education opportunities for marginalized students. This paper explores whether open and networked learning environments ought to be used to increase access to higher education and promote social justice for Indigenous students in Canada.

#### Objectives or purposes of the inquiry;

The purpose of this inquiry was to examine whether there is a conflict between Indigenous ways of knowing and learning and the pedagogy of open, networked learning. If there is a conflict, then using open, networked technologies to increase access to higher education for Indigenous Peoples in Canada may actually reinforce culturally oppressive educational practices. However, if there is not a conflict, or if the apparent conflict can be resolved, then, in alignment with the recommendations of the *Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada*, open, networked learning environments may be an ideal way to increase participation and attainment in higher education for Indigenous Peoples in Canada, especially for those who live in remote communities.

#### The philosophical, theoretical, or conceptual framework;

Understanding whether or not open and networked technologies are suitable for promoting social justice for Indigenous Peoples requires a clear understanding of each of three intersecting components, social justice, open and networked education, and Indigenous education. For this inquiry, social justice is understood in alignment with Lambert's (2018) description of socially just open learning environments which focus on "redistributive justice, recognitive justice [and] representational justice" (p. 227). Redistributive justice is the act of making resources more readily available to those populations who may have less, recognitive justice engenders greater respect for marginalized voices, and representational justice involves giving voice to those who have been excluded from discourse. Lambert uses the example of an open textbook freely provided to a marginalized group (redistributive justice), but if that textbook does not include examples or illustrations drawn from the marginalized culture, then it lacks recognitive justice, and if it is written by and from the perspective of the dominant group, then it lacks representational justice. She offers the following definition of socially just OE:

> Open Education is the development of free digitally enabled learning materials and experiences primarily by and for the benefit and empowerment of non-privileged learners who may be under-represented in education systems or marginalised in their global context. Success of social justice aligned programs can be measured not by any particular technical feature or format, but instead by the extent to which they enact redistributive justice, recognitive justice and/or representational justice.
